# Progress Ledger

The first thing to read in any new session. Update it at the end of every phase.

**Current state:** Phase 03 complete — the reading loop works end to end with zero model calls:
seven-step flow (question / open reflection, optional life area, spread incl. custom, deck with
instant accent + naming switch, source, cards by server-side seeded draw or physical entry with
reversals/reorder/back-date, "what I notice"), transactional save through `create_reading()`,
drafts in sessionStorage + `reading_drafts`, detail screen with reference meanings per position and
an honest "Not generated" AI slot, edit/delete, follow-up status, post-save revisit chips, custom
spreads, Home "Still open", 40 demo readings over 6 months. Invariant
`opening-reading-makes-no-ai-call` live. Physical 3-card log: 20.5 s human-paced.
Full gate green (90 e2e × 8 runs, 1 load-related flake fixed by a 10 s expect timeout).
**Next phase:** [Phase 04 — AI boundary + interpretation](phases/phase-04-ai-interpretation.md)

## Invariant test ledger

Each must be unskipped by the phase shown and never weakened afterwards. See
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md#principles).

## Open questions carried forward

Add anything a phase discovered but could not settle. Remove when resolved.

- Thoth artwork: shipping the typographic treatment only (see `docs/LICENSING.md`). Schema and
  renderer accept per-card art (`art_asset_path`, `art_strategy = 'original_commissioned'`) if
  licensed or commissioned art becomes available (§6.7 artwork rights).
- Thoth reversals: `supports_reversals = false` and null reversed meanings (deck reads by dignity).
  If Thoth readers who do use reversals ask for them, it is a data change plus authored text, not
  a schema change.
- Pricing numbers are placeholders until retention data exists (§14).
- Google OAuth credentials: not present in any environment yet. The flow is wired and tested up to
  the provider redirect; the owner must create a Google OAuth client and export
  `SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/_SECRET` (local) / set them on the hosted project.
- Local Supabase runs on ports 55321–55329 (another project owns 54xxx on the dev machine).
  `.env.example`/README/CI all use 55xxx; nothing depends on the defaults.

## Deferred items backlog

Phases append here when they defer something, so nothing is lost between sessions.

| Item | Deferred in | Moved to | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Install PWA on a physical phone, verify offline shell | 00 → 01 → 03 | 12 | No device in any session so far; manifest/SW verified by e2e only |
| Google OAuth end to end with real credentials | 01 | owner / 12 | No client ID/secret available; wired and tested to the provider redirect |
| Shared auth rate-limit store (in-memory today, per instance) | 01 | 12 | `RateLimitStore` interface ready; Supabase Auth limits sit behind it |
| ~~`profiles.default_deck_id` FK to `decks`~~ | 01 | 02 ✅ | done in `0003_deck_reference` |
| Purge `%@test.local` users created by e2e runs | 01 | 12 | Harmless locally; CI DB is ephemeral |
| `ai_calls` write in `telemetry.ts` | 00 | 04 | Table lands in 04; sink interface + memory sink in place |
| Real per-user budgets (`BudgetPolicy`) | 00 | 11 | `usage_counters` lands in 11; hook wired and tested |
| Sentry source-map upload | 00 | 12 | Scrubbing proven without it |
| ~~Live deck switch inside a flow (no navigation)~~ | 02 | 03 ✅ | Deck step switches accent and naming in place |
| `fixtures/decks/` recorded fixtures | 02 | 04 | Purity tests use the pure seed modules; recorded fixtures belong with the first AI task |
| Change deck or spread of a saved reading | 03 | 05 (if asked) | Edit covers question, date, life area and cards; a deck/spread change invalidates every card, so re-logging is the honest path for now |
| Soft delete (`deleted_at`) for readings | 03 | 05 | Hard delete now (nothing derived exists); the purge job lands with the derived tables |
| Server-side card search RPC / Thoth `strength` ranking | 03 | — | In the Thoth picker, `strength` ranks Nine of Wands (titled *Strength*) above Lust (alias); correct per Phase 02 ranking, noted for UX review |
